# Software Engineering Visualisation Project

**by Liam O Lionaird [19335530] for CSU33012 - Software Engineering.**

## Concept: *Big Tech Open Source: Employees vs. The World*

Just how 'open' are big tech's new open-source project ventures? How much do outside contributors *actually* contribute in comparison to employees? This visualisation analyses commits from a long-running and popular open-source project from Microsoft, [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). It sorts contributions from employees and from outsiders, and presents the results.
